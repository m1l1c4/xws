zanimljivo endDate nije samo je startDate
opis napada:
The Path Traversal attack technique allows an attacker access to files, directories, and commands that potentially reside outside the web document root directory. An attacker may manipulate a URL in such a way that the web site will execute or reveal the contents of arbitrary files anywhere on the web server. 
Any device that exposes an HTTP-based interface is potentially vulnerable to Path Traversal.
Most web sites restrict user access to a specific portion of the file-system, typically called the "web document root" or "CGI root" directory. 
These directories contain the files intended for user access and the executable necessary to drive web application functionality. 
To access files or execute commands anywhere on the file-system, Path Traversal attacks will utilize the ability of special-characters sequences.

# Buffer Overflow
opis: Buffer overflow errors are characterized by the overwriting of memory spaces of the background web process, which should have never been modified intentionally or unintentionally. Overwriting values of the IP (Instruction Pointer), BP (Base Pointer) and other registers causes exceptions, 
segmentation faults, and other process errors to occur. Usually these errors end execution of the application in an unexpected way. 
kako spreciti: Rewrite the background program using proper return length checking

# The cache-control and pragma HTTP header have not been set properly or are missing allowing the browser and proxies to cache content.
# The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing 
on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. 
Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.
