# The cache-control and pragma HTTP header have not been set properly or are missing allowing the browser and proxies to cache content.
# The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing 
on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. 
Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.
